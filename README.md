This project (MyJava) is a collection of working examples for various simple constructs in Java, plus assorted other topics and advice.  Since I am a neophyte in Java, this may not be useful to others, but I really constructed these pages to help a friend of mine.  

They are on github because I wanted to improve my `git` fu, and practice using a remote repository.

The files posted here comprise the source to be used by [Sphinx][1] to generate pages in html.  The html is not part of this repository.  If you wish to generate it yourself, you need to install Sphinx (`pip install sphinx`) and then do `make html` from within the project directory.

I have also put a zipped copy of the pages, as of this writing, on Dropbox [here][2].
