Setting up
##########

An installer for Java is available from Oracle.  Make sure you do not have the Java plug-in activated in your browser when you're done.  I have

.. sourcecode:: bash

    > javac -version
    javac 1.8.0_11

I place the following code in a file ``Hello.java`` on my Desktop

.. sourcecode:: java

    class Hello {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        }
    }

and from the command line (in the Desktop directory), I do

.. sourcecode:: bash

    > javac Hello.java 
    > java Hello
    Hello World!
    >

So that's all there is to the install.

The file that is generated by the compiler is ``Hello.class``:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    > ls Hello.*
    Hello.class	Hello.java
    >
